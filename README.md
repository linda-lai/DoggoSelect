## Background
Hi, hello and hey! I'm currently a student at Coder Academy completing a Diploma of Information Technology in a full-stack web development immersive bootcamp, learning JavaScript concepts for the first time.

## DoggoSelect
This repository follows Treehouse's [Working with Fetch API](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/working-with-the-fetch-api) tutorial to practice:

* Making a basic fetch request
* Displaying the content
* Creating a reusable fetch function
* Handling errors
* Managing multiple requests with Promise.all
* Posting data with fetch()
